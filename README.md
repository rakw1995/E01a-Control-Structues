# E01a-Control-Structues

The following code is a game that asks the user to answer the question correctly. In this example the question is "What is my favorite color?"
The correct answer will be chosen at random from the following list of colors:

* red
* orange
* yellow 
* green 
* blue
* violet
* purple 

The player is given the opportunity to input a color. 

1. When correct, the game shows the dialogue "correct"
2. When incorrect, the dialogue "Sorry, try again." is shown and gives the player the opportunity to make another attempt.

If the player scores better in one round than the last, the dialogue will say "this was your best guess so far."

To play again, the user just needs to input a new color to begin.
If the player chooses not to replay, the dialogue will say "thanks for playing!"
